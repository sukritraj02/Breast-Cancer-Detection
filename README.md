# ðŸ©º Breast Cancer Detection

## ðŸ“˜ Overview
This project aims to build a *machine learning model* that detects whether a tumor is *malignant* or *benign* based on medical diagnostic data.  
It demonstrates the full pipeline â€” from *data preprocessing* and *model training* to *evaluation and deployment* â€” using Python and scikit-learn.

## âš™ Technologies Used
- *Python 3.12*
- *Pandas, NumPy* â€“ data handling  
- *Scikit-learn* â€“ model training & evaluation  
- *Matplotlib / Seaborn* â€“ visualization  
- *Jupyter Notebook* â€“ development environment  

---

## ðŸ§  Workflow
1. *Data Preprocessing*
   - Cleaned and encoded dataset  
   - Handled missing values and normalized features  

2. *Model Training*
   - Used *Logistic Regression* as a baseline model  
   - Split dataset into training and test sets  
   - Evaluated performance using accuracy and confusion matrix  

3. *Model Saving*
   - Serialized the trained model using pickle as model.pkl
